"""Insert text into the frontmost app: clipboard + simulated Cmd-V.

The clipboard route is the de-facto standard for dictation apps — one
paste event works in nearly every app (native, Electron, web) and is
instant regardless of text length. The previous clipboard string is
restored afterwards unless something else wrote to the pasteboard in
the meantime (e.g. a clipboard manager).

Posting the Cmd-V key event requires the hosting app to have
Accessibility permission; without it the event is silently dropped.
