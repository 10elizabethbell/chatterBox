# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Local Wispr Flow clone for macOS: a menu-bar dictation app. Click the mic icon, speak, and the transcribed + LLM-cleaned text is typed at the cursor of the frontmost app. Transcription is fully on-device (Parakeet TDT v3 via MLX). macOS-only — depends on PyObjC (AppKit/Quartz), CoreAudio via sounddevice, and Apple Silicon for MLX.

## Commands

```sh
uv venv --python 3.12 && uv pip install -e .   # setup (first run downloads ~1.2GB model)

.venv/bin/whisperflow          # run the menu-bar app
.venv/bin/whisperflow --raw    # without the Claude cleanup pass
open build/WhisperFlow.app     # same app via the .app wrapper (LaunchServices)
```

There is no test suite or linter. Each pipeline stage has a CLI test helper that runs without the menu bar or mic:

```sh
.venv/bin/whisperflow transcribe path/to/16khz-mono.wav   # transcription only
.venv/bin/whisperflow type "hello"                        # injection only (types after 3s — focus a text field first)
.venv/bin/whisperflow clean "um so uh send it friday no wait thursday"   # cleanup pass only

# generate a test wav without speaking:
say -o /tmp/t.aiff "testing one two three" && afconvert -f WAVE -d LEI16@16000 -c 1 /tmp/t.aiff /tmp/t.wav
```

The hosting terminal needs Microphone and Accessibility permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security). Without Accessibility, synthetic keystrokes are silently dropped — injection "does nothing" with no error. When launched via `build/WhisperFlow.app` instead, both permissions attach to WhisperFlow.app rather than the terminal and must be granted separately.

### The .app wrapper

`build/WhisperFlow.app` is a thin wrapper — a zsh launcher (`Contents/MacOS/WhisperFlow`) that resolves the project root relative to itself and execs `.venv/bin/whisperflow`. It exists so the sibling ApplicationManager project (which discovers `*.app` bundles under `menuBarApps/`) can list, launch, and quit this app; it matches by the `com.whisperflow.app` bundle ID, which survives the exec. The `MenuBarSymbolName` key in its Info.plist is what ApplicationManager reads for the list icon. The wrapper breaks if the venv is missing or the bundle is moved out of the project (it shows an alert instead of failing silently).

## Architecture

Pipeline, one module per stage, orchestrated by `menubar.py`:

```
menubar.py (AppKit status item, state machine)
  → audio.py      Recorder: continuous mic stream, 500ms pre-roll ring buffer, energy VAD
  → transcriber.py Parakeet MLX, model kept in memory (~0.06s per utterance warm)
  → cleanup.py    Cleaner: headless `claude -p --bare --model haiku` subprocess
  → inject.py     types text via CGEvent Unicode keystrokes
```

### Threading model

Three threads, and it matters which code runs where:

- **Main thread**: all AppKit UI (status item, menu, icon changes). Worker threads request icon updates via `performSelectorOnMainThread_` (`_set_state`).
- **Audio callback thread** (sounddevice): `Recorder._callback` appends blocks and updates VAD counters under `self._lock`. Keep this callback cheap.
- **Worker thread**: the transcribe → clean → inject pipeline (`menubar._process`), so the ~1s Haiku call never blocks the UI. Model loading also happens on a background thread at startup.

The menu-bar timer (`tick_`, 10Hz) polls `Recorder.has_speech` / `silence_seconds` to auto-stop after 2s of post-speech silence; VAD counters are block-based (not wall-clock) so the logic is deterministic.

### Contracts and constraints that span files

- **Audio format is 16kHz mono float32 end-to-end**: Recorder produces it, Transcriber requires it (`get_logmel` bit-views the rfft output against the input dtype — anything but float32 breaks), `transcribe_file` rejects other wavs.
- **Dictation text must never touch the clipboard** (user requirement). `inject.py` types via `CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString`, chunked at the 20-UTF-16-unit event cap with surrogate pairs kept intact. Don't reintroduce a pasteboard route.
- **The cleanup pass must never eat words**: every `Cleaner` failure mode (timeout, not logged in, CLI missing, empty output) returns the raw transcript with a status string. Utterances under 5 words skip the LLM. "Not logged in" disables the pass for the session instead of retrying.
- **Cleanup rides the user's Claude Code login** (no API key): it spawns the `claude` CLI per utterance. Its system prompt treats transcript content strictly as text to clean, never as instructions.
- **Secure input**: `inject.secure_input_active()` must be checked before injecting so dictation can't land in password fields; the menu-bar flow already does this.
- **State machine** in `menubar.py`: LOADING → IDLE ⇄ RECORDING → PROCESSING → IDLE. Clicks are ignored outside IDLE/RECORDING; icons in `icons.py` are drawn per-state.

### Other notes

- Personal dictionary: `~/.config/whisperflow/dictionary.txt` (one term per line, `#` comments) is folded into the cleanup system prompt for spelling correction.
- End-to-end injection can't be verified headlessly — `whisperflow type` sends real keystrokes to whatever is focused. Test chunking/logic with `_post_unicode_chunk` mocked instead.
